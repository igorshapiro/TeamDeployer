Polls TeamCity for new builds and deploys them.
Really sorry for the ugly code. First steps with Ruby :)
-----------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
- Ruby 1.9.2 (didn't test on lower)

Configuration file format:

  port: 8080                    # teamcity server port
  user: me                      # teamcity user (dedicated deployment user is recommended)
  password: my_pwd              # password

  -
    project-name: WebProject                    # project name from Teamcity
    artifact-name: "WebProject-@build.zip"      # Artifact name. @build will be replaced
    app-pool-name: "WebSite"                    # IIS Application pool name (optional)
